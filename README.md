# Meower-Web
Meower Search Engine... that doesn't actually search
At the moment, Meower Web is just an index page and nothing else.
## Why?
Meower is all about being safe, so it would be a no-brainer to create a non-tracking search engine.
## What about DuckDuckGo?
If you haven't heard, DuckDuckGo was under fire for tracking you, the literal thing they were against.
Meower Web will be a search engine... soon
when I learn more programming.
